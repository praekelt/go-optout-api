"""
This is where the description of what an opt out backend should be
capable of will go. Such a description is called an 'interface'.

The package 'zope.interfaces' provides tools for writing these. You
can find documentation at
http://docs.zope.org/zope.interface/README.html#defining-interfaces.

Initially the interface will have just two methods -- one for getting
and opt out and one for setting an opt out.

The implementations of the interfaces should go in memory.py and
riak.py. Start with the memory.py one and leave the Riak one for
later.
