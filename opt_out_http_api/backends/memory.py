This is where we will put the in-memory opt out store that we
will use for testing and simple demos.

Essentially it's the same as the implementation that exists in
api_methods right now (i.e. a list of opt outs in memory), but
it will conform to the interface in backends.interface and
perhaps be a little nicer.
